\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

The EPS 2.0\nomenclature{\textbf{EPS}}{\textit{Electric Power System.}} is a PCB\nomenclature{\textbf{PCB}}{\textit{Printed Circuit Board.}} designed to harvest, store and distribute energy for a nanosatellite. It is one of the service modules developed for FloripaSat-2 CubeSat Mission \cite{floripasat2-doc}. The energy harvesting system is based on solar energy conversion through ten solar panels attached to the 2U CubeSat structure. The EPS 2.0 is designed to operate the solar panels at their maximum power point (MPPT)\nomenclature{\textbf{MPPT}}{\textit{Maximum Power Point Tracking.}}. The board is also responsible for measuring solar panels current, voltage, and temperature of both the panels and the batteries. The harvested solar energy is stored in the Battery Module 4C \cite{bat4c} connected to the EPS. Several integrated buck DC-DC converters do the energy distribution. The total EPS system comprises solar panels, the EPS 2.0 PCB, and the battery module. A general view of the EPS 2.0 board can be seen in \autoref{fig:general-view}.

The module is a direct upgrade from the EPS of FloripaSat-1 \cite{eps-fsat}, which grants a flight heritage rating. The improvements focus on providing a cleaner and more generic implementation compared to the previous version, more reliability in software, and adaptations for the new mission requirements. All the project (source and documentation files) is available freely on a GitHub repository \cite{eps2} under its respective licenses.
